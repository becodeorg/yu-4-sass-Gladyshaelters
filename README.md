Instructions
Part 0
Copy the files index.html and style.css in your new repo. Rename your style.css to style.scss to be able to make use of all scss features. The info above will help you compile it back to css, as a browser cannot read scss.

Part 1 - a lot of possibilities
Don't rush for the solution here. Take your time to try out the different possibilities SASS is granting you.

A. Nest the styling rules of grouped elements, like the sections in the article.
B. Make one mixin for the 3 lines of the box-shadow styling.
C. Use one variable for the general padding value that you see in multiple places (Note: the footer h6 has double the padding of the other elements. Use math operations to calculate it).
D. Make use of extend to re-use the same CSS for the "success", "error" and "warning" messages.
Part 2 - an extra challenge!
In the HTML, add 2 links called "blue" & "red".
Clicking one of the 2 links should change the text to red/blue with a good matching background (keep it readable)!
Note: the rest of the CSS should be the same and should not be repeated, to do this you will have to use SASS variables and file imports.
Take some time to think how to do the structure of this second part (you will probably need additional files wink wink). It might be good to discuss this with your fellow juniors!

ðŸŒ¼ Nice to haves
Part 3
Add an option to your compilation script to minify your stylesheet!
Mine was below 1.6k, can you do better? Do you still remember the option to ls to make the filesize Human readable?
